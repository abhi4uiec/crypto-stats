# Crypto Stats

A java web application that gathers statistics of cryptocurrency.

## CSV Format
* In the CRYPTO_NAME_values.csv (e.g. BTC_values.csv) you can find one monthâ€™s prices for
  one crypto in USD.
* The file has the following format:
    timestamp, symbol, price

## Requirements for the recommendation service
* Reads all the prices from the csv files
* Calculates oldest/newest/min/max for each crypto for the whole month
* Exposes an endpoint that will return a descending sorted list of all the cryptos,
comparing the normalized range (i.e. (max-min)/min)
* Exposes an endpoint that will return the oldest/newest/min/max values for a requested
crypto
* Exposes an endpoint that will return the crypto with the highest normalized range for a
specific day

## Extra mile for recommendation service (optional):
* Malicious users will always exist, so it will be really beneficial if at least we can rate limit
them (based on IP)

## Installations needed

* Java 17
* Spring 3
* Gradle

## Running
